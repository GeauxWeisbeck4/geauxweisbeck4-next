# Welcome to Andrew's Digital Garden

I finally have created and deployed my Digital Garden! This has been a make in the workings for quite some time now, so I am excited that I finally chose a solution I liked and went with it. The Next.js Tailwind Blog starter was a perfect choice for this project when I sit back and look how it has initially turned out.

## What is going on in your garden?

Well there is quite a lot actually, but the most important being that it is a place where I can work in public and share with you what I've got going on! And hopefully I can get some feedback from the public on how to implement ideas, or if the ideas is good or bad. I think a lot of my issues creating projects has been creating them in the dark where nobody can see them - they need light to grow.

A garden is a perfect place for things to grow actually, so you should consider having your own 'digital garden'. I'll have a post on how to do so, my newsletter, and how to join my Quora space on digital gardens!

## Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think!

I hope you enjoyed this post and let me know what you think about the digital garden first version! There is still a lot of work to be done which you can check in the [GitHub Repository README](https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4/geauxweisbeck4-next).
